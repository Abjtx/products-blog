                    Touch typing
                    Typing zones on a QWERTY keyboard for each finger taken from KTouch and home row keys
                    Typing zones on a QWERTY keyboard for each finger taken from KTouch (home row keys are circled)
                    Main article: Touch typing

                    The basic technique stands in contrast to hunt and peck typing in which the typist keeps their eyes
                    on
                    the source copy at all times. Touch typing also involves the use of the home row method, where
                    typists
                    rest their wrist down, rather than lifting up and typing (which can cause carpal tunnel syndrome).
                    To
                    avoid this, typists should sit up tall, leaning slightly forward from the waist, place their feet
                    flat
                    on the floor in front of them with one foot slightly in front of the other, and keep their elbows
                    close
                    to their sides with forearms slanted slightly upward to the keyboard; fingers should be curved
                    slightly
                    and rest on the home row.

                    Many touch typists also use keyboard shortcuts when typing on a computer. This allows them to edit
                    their
                    document without having to take their hands off the keyboard to use a mouse. An example of a
                    keyboard
                    shortcut is pressing the Ctrl key plus the S key to save a document as they type, or the Ctrl key
                    plus
                    the Z key to undo a mistake. Other shortcuts are the Ctrl key plus the C to copy and the Ctrl key
                    and
                    the V key to paste, and the Ctrl key and the X key to cut. Many experienced typists can feel or
                    sense
                    when they have made an error and can hit the ← Backspace key and make the correction with no
                    increase in
                    time between keystrokes.
                    Hunt and peck

                    Hunt and peck (two-fingered typing) is a common form of typing in which the typist presses each key
                    individually. Instead of relying on the memorized position of keys, the typist must find each key by
                    sight. The use of this method may also prevent the typist from being able to see what has been typed
                    without glancing away from the keys. Although good accuracy may be achieved, any typing errors that
                    are
                    made may not be noticed immediately due to the user not looking at the screen. There is also the
                    disadvantage that because fewer fingers are used, those that are used are forced to move a much
                    greater
                    distance.
                    Civilian Conservation Corps typing class, 1933
                    Hybrid

                    There are many idiosyncratic typing styles in between novice-style "hunt and peck" and touch typing.
                    For
                    example, many "hunt and peck" typists have the keyboard layout memorized and are able to type while
                    focusing their gaze on the screen. Some use just two fingers, while others use 3–6 fingers. Some use
                    their fingers very consistently, with the same finger being used to type the same character every
                    time,
                    while others vary the way they use their fingers.

                    One study examining 30 subjects, of varying different styles and expertise, has found minimal
                    difference
                    in typing speed between touch typists and self-taught hybrid typists.[3] According to the study,
                    "The
                    number of fingers does not determine typing speed... People using self-taught typing strategies were
                    found to be as fast as trained typists... instead of the number of fingers, there are other factors
                    that
                    predict typing speed... fast typists... keep their hands fixed on one position, instead of moving
                    them
                    over the keyboard, and more consistently use the same finger to type a certain letter." To quote
                    doctoral candidate Anna Feit: "We were surprised to observe that people who took a typing course,
                    performed at similar average speed and accuracy, as those that taught typing to themselves and only
                    used
                    6 fingers on average"

                                <h3>Case Study: Amazon Fire Phone</h3>
                                <p class="m-1">In July 2014, Amazon entered the smartphone market with the launch of the Fire Phone, 
                                    aiming to extend its reach beyond e-commerce and digital content into the highly competitive mobile device industry. 
                                    However, despite Amazon’s reputation and resources, the Fire Phone was a commercial failure, 
                                    and it was discontinued in less than two years. This case study examines the strategic missteps, product management decisions, 
                                    and lessons learned from the Fire Phone's failure.</p>

                                <p class="m-1">Google Glass, introduced in 2012 as part of Google's "Project Glass," 
                                    was a wearable augmented reality (AR) headset resembling eyeglasses. 
                                    It promised to revolutionize mobile computing by enabling hands-free interaction with technology. 
                                    However, despite early excitement, Google Glass failed commercially and was discontinued for consumers in 2015.
    
                                    This case study examines the key reasons behind Google Glass's failure, 
                                    the role of product management in the process, and the lessons learned.</p>

                                    Despite being backed by Google’s vast resources and integrated across the Google ecosystem,

                                <h3>Case Study: Microsoft Vista</h3>
                                <p class="m-1">
                                    Microsoft Windows Vista, launched in 2007, was intended to be a major upgrade over the highly successful Windows XP. 
                                    Vista introduced new features such as improved security, a redesigned user interface, and advanced multimedia capabilities. 
                                    However, it faced significant backlash due to poor performance, compatibility issues, and a complex user experience. 
                                    By 2009, Microsoft had to move forward with Windows 7, effectively admitting that Vista had failed to meet expectations. 
                                    This case study analyzes the failure of Vista, focusing on product strategy, user feedback, performance issues, and key lessons for product managers.

                                    The Microsoft Zune, launched in 2006, was a portable media player designed to compete with Apple’s iPod. 
                                    Despite Microsoft's efforts, the Zune failed to capture significant market share and was discontinued in 2011. 
                                    This case study analyzes Zune’s product strategy, market positioning, 
                                    features, user experience, and factors leading to its failure, offering insights from a product management perspective.

                                <h3>Case Study: Samsung Galaxy Note 7</h3>
                                <p class="m-1">
                                    In August 2016, Samsung launched the Galaxy Note 7, which was intended to be one of its flagship devices, showcasing cutting-edge technology and design. 
                                    The Note 7 boasted advanced features such as an iris scanner, enhanced stylus functionality, and a high-performance battery. 
                                    However, within a few weeks of its release, reports of battery explosions and overheating began to surface. 
                                    What was initially expected to be a market-leading product turned into one of the biggest product recalls in tech history. 
                                    By October 2016, Samsung permanently discontinued the Galaxy Note 7.
    
                                    This case study examines the product failures that led to the recall, the impact on Samsung’s brand, and key lessons for product managers.
