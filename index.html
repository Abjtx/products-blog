                            <p class="m-1">In July 2014, Amazon entered the smartphone market with the launch of the Fire Phone, 
                                aiming to extend its reach beyond e-commerce and digital content into the highly competitive mobile device industry. 
                                However, despite Amazon’s reputation and resources, the Fire Phone was a commercial failure, 
                                and it was discontinued in less than two years. This case study examines the strategic missteps, product management decisions, 
                                and lessons learned from the Fire Phone's failure.</p>

                            <h3>Facebook Product Growth Strategy</h3>
                            <p class="m-1"> The growth of Facebook as a product from inception to now has been nothing short of remarkable. 
                                In this case study, we are going to look at Facebook's growth across the product lifecycle.
                                When Facebook was first introduced into the market, 
                                it first focused on college graduates as their target users. 
                                They adopted the strategy of ‘exclusivity’ by opening only to a few colleges first. 
                                Other products to have followed a similar strategy are Gmail which was invited only at first.</p>

                            <p class="m-1">Google Glass, introduced in 2012 as part of Google's "Project Glass," 
                                was a wearable augmented reality (AR) headset resembling eyeglasses. 
                                It promised to revolutionize mobile computing by enabling hands-free interaction with technology. 
                                However, despite early excitement, Google Glass failed commercially and was discontinued for consumers in 2015.

                                This case study examines the key reasons behind Google Glass's failure, 
                                the role of product management in the process, and the lessons learned.</p>

                                aiming to compete with Facebook, Twitter, and other established social platforms. 
                                Despite being backed by Google’s vast resources and integrated across the Google ecosystem, 
                                Google+ failed to gain traction and was officially shut down in 2019.

                                Microsoft Windows Vista, launched in 2007, was intended to be a major upgrade over the highly successful Windows XP. 
                                Vista introduced new features such as improved security, a redesigned user interface, and advanced multimedia capabilities. 
                                However, it faced significant backlash due to poor performance, compatibility issues, and a complex user experience. 
                                By 2009, Microsoft had to move forward with Windows 7, effectively admitting that Vista had failed to meet expectations. 
                                This case study analyzes the failure of Vista, focusing on product strategy, user feedback, performance issues, and key lessons for product managers.

                                The Microsoft Zune, launched in 2006, was a portable media player designed to compete with Apple’s iPod. 
                                Despite Microsoft's efforts, the Zune failed to capture significant market share and was discontinued in 2011.

                                features, user experience, and factors leading to its failure, offering insights from a product management perspective.

                                In August 2016, Samsung launched the Galaxy Note 7, which was intended to be one of its flagship devices, showcasing cutting-edge technology and design. 
                                The Note 7 boasted advanced features such as an iris scanner, enhanced stylus functionality, and a high-performance battery. 
                                However, within a few weeks of its release, reports of battery explosions and overheating began to surface. 
                                What was initially expected to be a market-leading product turned into one of the biggest product recalls in tech history. 
                                By October 2016, Samsung permanently discontinued the Galaxy Note 7.

                                This case study examines the product failures that led to the recall, the impact on Samsung’s brand, and key lessons for product managers.
